"""
Unit tests for the LaplacianEnergy method.

This module contains tests for the functionality of the LaplacianEnergy class,
including energy map computation. It ensures that the laplacian operator method
behaves as expected when applied to sample images.

Components Tested:
- LaplacianEnergy class:
  - Energy table calculation functionality.

Dependencies:
- numpy: Used to generate sample image data for testing.
- LaplacianEnergy: The main class being tested.
