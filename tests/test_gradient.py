"""
Unit tests for the GradientEnergy method.

This module contains tests for the functionality of the GradientEnergy class,
including energy map computation. It ensures that the gradient energy method
behaves as expected when applied to sample images.

Components Tested:
- GradientEnergy class:
  - Energy table calculation functionality.

Dependencies:
- numpy: Used to generate sample image data for testing.
- GradientEnergy: The main class being tested.
- Constants (BORDER_ENERGY): Used to define border energy values.
