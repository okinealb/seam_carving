"""
This module implements the Sobel energy method for seam carving, providing an
energy map computation based on the Sobel operator. The Sobel operator is
commonly used in image processing to detect edges by calculating the
gradient magnitude at each pixel. 

For more information, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator).
